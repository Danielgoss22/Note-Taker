# Note-Taker

## Description

- I wanted to create a notes app in order to organize and manage my day while working through class materials.

- I figured out that working with GET and POST routes I needed to be careful with syntax and how I ordered my code because I had a lot of porblems with creating the information I needed.

- I had Juan Delgado (a tutor) help me to clarify how I needed to think through and organize my code in order to get started with my project.
